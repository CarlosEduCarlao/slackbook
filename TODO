General

* Aim to update references to kernel versions and Slackware versions to those 
  used in the most recent release of Slackware. I've seen kernel 2.6.29.4 and 
  Slackware 12.0.0 for instance.

* cron

* Process control: ps, top, jobs, kill, etc.

* more extensive CLI apps like v2.0

* no idea where the hell udev is covered in here, but we need to do a bit of
  talk about it.  Nothing too advanced, and we definitely DO NOT want to 
  imply that users should have to do much with udev.  All of the asshattery
  out there with trying to automount shit with udev is, well, asshattery.
  * need to mention that /etc/udev/rules.d/<somefile> overrides an identically
    named file in /lib/udev/rules.d/
  * need to mention persistent rules that are system-generated, especially
    in reference to how the admin might be misled into thinking that they are
    causing breakage...


Chapter 3. Booting

* Section 'mkinitrd'

* /usr/share/mkinitrd_command_generator.sh

  "Now that we've created out initrd" -> "Now that we've created our initrd"
  "most of these warnings are issued by the use of LVM" << I think that at 
    this point of the book, people will be scared off by the unfamiliar 
    'LVM' and listing "/dev/raven/64root" as a root device may be confusing 
    to people who expect something like "/dev/sda1". Better to discuss LVM 
    later on.


Chapter 4. Basic Shell Commands

* Section 'Reading Documents'

  Perhaps split this with subsections for cat, more, and less?

Chapter 6. X Windows

* Section 'configuring the X server'

  "The second most popular way to configure X on your system is the handy 
  xorgconfig(1)." << Factually, this is no longer true. The xorgconfig and 
  xorgcfg utilities have been removed as per Slackware 13.0.  What you 
  *should* mention is that the X in Slackware will auto-configure itself 
  if a xorg.conf file is missing (or will automatically configure components 
  for any sections that are missing from an existing xorg.conf using the 
  information it receives from the HAL daemon)
  * note that HAL is slated for deprecation and this might be handled by
    udev directly at some point in the future...


Chapter 8. Users and Groups

* Section 'Other User and Group Tools'

  You could mention the tool here that is most sought after in IRC and 
  forums: the "gpasswd" program which allows you to add a user to one 
  additional group without touching on your current group management 
  (remember that "usermod -G" will not retain your current group membership 
  while "gpasswd -a" will).


Chapter 10. Working with Filesystems

* Section 'Local Filesystem Types'

  Do not forget to mention ext4.

* Section 'Network Filesystems' / 'NFS'

  You could mention here how the command "showmount -e <remote_server> " 
  allows you to find out exactly what NFS exports a remote server has made 
  available.


Chapter 11. vi

* Table 11.2. vi Cheat Sheet

  You should really add "dw" (delete a word - and store it in the 
  copybuffer)  "yw" (copy a word to the copy buffer), "yy" (copy a line to 
  the copy buffer) and "p" (paste the content of the copybuffer at the 
  cursor's location)


Chapter 15. Basic Networking Commands

* Section 'Web Browsers'

  Should we include curl along with the others?

* Section 'NNTP Clients'

  Should we even have this section?  At this time, I'm leaning towards 'no'.
