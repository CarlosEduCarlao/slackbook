General

* Aim to update references to kernel versions and Slackware versions to those 
  used in the most recent release of Slackware. I've seen kernel 2.6.29.4 and 
  Slackware 12.0.0 for instance.

* more extensive CLI apps like v2.0

* no idea where the hell udev is covered in here, but we need to do a bit of
  talk about it.  Nothing too advanced, and we definitely DO NOT want to 
  imply that users should have to do much with udev.  All of the asshattery
  out there with trying to automount shit with udev is, well, asshattery.
  * need to mention that /etc/udev/rules.d/<somefile> overrides an identically
    named file in /lib/udev/rules.d/
  * need to mention persistent rules that are system-generated, especially
    in reference to how the admin might be misled into thinking that they are
    causing breakage...

Chapter 4. Basic Shell Commands

* Section 'Reading Documents'

  Perhaps split this with subsections for cat, more, and less?

Chapter 6. X Windows

* Section 'configuring the X server'

  "The second most popular way to configure X on your system is the handy 
  xorgconfig(1)." << Factually, this is no longer true. The xorgconfig and 
  xorgcfg utilities have been removed as per Slackware 13.0.  What you 
  *should* mention is that the X in Slackware will auto-configure itself 
  if a xorg.conf file is missing (or will automatically configure components 
  for any sections that are missing from an existing xorg.conf using the 
  information it receives from the HAL daemon)
  * note that HAL is slated for deprecation and this might be handled by
    udev directly at some point in the future...

Chapter 10. Working with Filesystems

* Section 'Network Filesystems' / 'NFS'

  You could mention here how the command "showmount -e <remote_server> " 
  allows you to find out exactly what NFS exports a remote server has made 
  available.

Chapter 16. Basic Networking Commands

* Additional tools to discuss: finger, host, dig, pine, mutt, nail
