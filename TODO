General

* Aim to update references to kernel versions and Slackware versions to those 
  used in the most recent release of Slackware. I've seen kernel 2.6.29.4 and 
  Slackware 12.0.0 for instance.

* more extensive CLI apps like v2.0

* no idea where the hell udev is covered in here, but we need to do a bit of
  talk about it.  Nothing too advanced, and we definitely DO NOT want to 
  imply that users should have to do much with udev.  All of the asshattery
  out there with trying to automount shit with udev is, well, asshattery.
  * need to mention that /etc/udev/rules.d/<somefile> overrides an identically
    named file in /lib/udev/rules.d/
  * need to mention persistent rules that are system-generated, especially
    in reference to how the admin might be misled into thinking that they are
    causing breakage...

Chapter 2. Installation

* Need to mention gdisk (for GPT parts) in the partitioning section

* At the tail end we might wish to tell the user about adduser and
  inform him that he can skip ahead to chapter 9 briefly if he needs
  more info.

Chapter 4. Basic Shell Commands

* Section 'Reading Documents'

  Perhaps split this with subsections for cat, more, and less?

Chapter 10. Working with Filesystems

* Section 'Network Filesystems' / 'NFS'

  You could mention here how the command "showmount -e <remote_server> " 
  allows you to find out exactly what NFS exports a remote server has made 
  available.

Chapter 14. Networking

* Add netconfig.  This is mandatory!

Chapter 16. Basic Networking Commands

* Additional tools to discuss: finger, host, dig, pine, mutt, nail

ps-imgs

* These can all be imported into the GIMP and converted to SVG, but
  leaving them in this format for now makes them much easier to modify.
