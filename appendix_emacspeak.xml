  <title>Emacspeak for Blind Users</title>

<para>
  Slackware Linux includes two methods of creating a blind-accessible
  distribution: the Speakup.s kernel and
  <application>emacspeak</application>.
</para>

<para>
  The Speakup.s kernel is configured to work with hardware
  speech-synthesizers which connect to a non-sighted user's computer
  and &#34;speaks&#34; whatever is sent to standard out.
</para>

<para>
  Not all non-sighted users have access to hardware
  speech-synthesizers and even those that do might find it cumbersome
  to carry one along with their laptop every time they go out. To
  account for this, <application>Emacspeak</application> was
  developed, by a non-sighted programmer, to create audio output from normal
  interactions in <application>Emacs</application>. Since
  <application>Emacs</application> is so extensible and has modes for
  shell access, office work, email, web browsing, file management, and
  so much more, it can act as the primary UI for the rest of the OS.
</para>

<section id="emacspeak_reqs">
  <title>Prerequisites</title>
  
<para>
  Before you install <application>Emacspeak</application>, you should
  (obviously) first have installed
  <application>Emacs</application>. If you excluded this from your
  initial install, then add it with
  <application>slackpkg</application> or
  <application>pkgtool</application> (it can be found in application
  set &#34;e&#34;).
</para>

<para>
  You should also have at least one user (not including root) on the
  system, and this user should be a member of the audio group.
</para>
</section>

<section id="emacspeak_install">
<title>Installing Emacspeak</title>
  
<para>
  <application>Emacspeak</application> can be installed over the
  network with <application>slackpkg</application>. See <xref
  linkend="pkg_slackpkg"/> for more information.
</para>

<screen>
  <prompt>darkstar:~&#35; </prompt><command>slackpkg</command> install emacspeak
</screen>

<para>
  You can also install it from the install media using
  <application>pkgtool</application> or
  <application>installpkg</application>. <application>Emacspeak</application>
  can be found in the <filename>&#47;extra</filename> directory on the
  disc.
</para>

<para>
  Once <application>Emacspeak</application> has been installed, it
  needs to be configured, but you can test that it has been installed
  by simply typing <command>emacspeak</command> at a shell
  prompt. <application>Emacs</application> will start and return some
  errors in the minibuffer; this is expected, since we have yet to
  configure the backend for sound.

<section id="emacspeak_config">
<title>Configuring Emacspeak</title>

<para>
  In order for <application>emacspeak</application> to produce sound,
  your system requires speech synthesizer software. As of this
  writing, <application>flite</application> is the most actively
  maintained and most reliable free speech synthesizer for
  Linux. While it does not ship with Slackware, it can be obtained
  as an RPM package from <ulink
  url="dl.fedoraproject.org/blah/blah/">LINK HERE</ulink>
  <!-- Its homepage <ulink
       url="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/flite/packed/flite-1.3/flite-1.3-release.tar.gz">http:&#47;&#47;www.speech.cs.cmu.edu&#47;flite&#47;packed&#47;flite-1.3&#47;flite-1.3-release.tar.gz</ulink-->
</para>

<para>
  Use <application>rpm2tgz</application> to convert the RPM package to
  a Slackware Package, and install using
  <application>installpkg</application> as discussed in <xref linkend="pkg_rpm2tgz"/>.
</para>

<para>
  You can test <application>flite</application> once it has been
  installed with the command <command>flite</command> <arg>-t</arg>
  <userinput>foo</userinput>. You should hear
  <application>flite</application> speak &#34;foo&#34;. If you do not,
  then either <application>flite</application> has not been installed
  correctly, or your computer's sound is not working or is
  muted. Check <application>alsamixer</application> to adjust the
  levels of your speakers, use <application>lsmod</application> to
  find out if your computer speakers are being recognized at all, and
  <command>which</command> <userinput>flite</userinput> to ensure that
  <application>flite</application> actually got installed.
</para>

<para>
  With <application>flite</application> and
  <application>emacspeak</application> confirmed, your system now has
  both the user interface and the speech synthesizer to vocalize input
  and output. The final component necessary is a speech server to
  bridge these two separate parts. The speech server that has been
  developed for <application>flite</application> is
  <application>eflite</application>, and is available directly from
  its homepage at <ulink
  url="http://eflite.sourceforge.net">eflite.sourceforge.net</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
  To build eflite from source code:
</para>

<screen>
  <prompt>darkstar:~&#36; </prompt>tar -xf eflite*gz &#38;&#38; cd eflite*
  <prompt>darkstar:~&#36; </prompt>make
  <prompt>darkstar:~&#36; </prompt>make test
</screen>

<para>
  The test should play a voice confirming that eflite is working
  properly.  If you hear nothing, do not install
  <application>eflite</application> until you diagnose and repair the
  problem.
</para>

<para>
  Assuming all goes well, install <application>eflite</application>&#58;
</para>

<screen>
    <prompt>darkstar:~&#36; </prompt>su -c &#39;make install&#39;
</screen>

<para>
  An environment variable needs to be established so that
  <application>emacspeak</application> knows what speech server to
  use:
</para>

<screen>
    <prompt>darkstar:~&#36; </prompt> echo
    &#34;DTK_PROGRAM=&#47;usr&#47;local&#47;bin&#47;eflite&#34; &#62;&#62; ~&#47;.bash_profile
    <prompt>darkstar:~&#36; </prompt> echo &#34;export DTK_PROGRAM"
    &#62;&#62; ~&#47;.bash_profile
    <prompt>darkstar~:&#36; </prompt> source ~&#47;.bash_profile
</screen>

<para>
  Launch <application>emacspeak</application> and you will find that
  every interaction is narrated.
</para>
</section>

<section id="emacspeak_usability">
<title>Usability Hacks</title>

<para>
  Strictly speaking, the <application>emacspeak</application> system
  is now fully configured. However, there are two useful modifications
  that should be made to help usability. As it is now, when the system
  boots, it runs through the usual init sequence and stops silently at
  a login prompt waiting for the user to enter their
  information. Obviously a silent prompt is meaningless to a
  non-sighted user.
</para>

<para>
  To create an audible login prompt, modify a startup script such that
  some command is initiated at the end of the boot sequence. The final
  script to be executed during the normal init sequence is
  <filename>&#47;etc&#47;rc.d&#47;rc.local</filename>, so modify it as root:
</para>

<screen>
  <prompt>darkstar:~&#35; </prompt> <command>echo</command> &#39;exec
  &#47;usr&#47;bin&#47;flite -t &#34;please log in.&#34;&#39; >>
  &#47;etc&#47;rc.d&#47;rc.local
</screen>

<para>
  Now the non-sighted user will know when it is time to log in to
  the computer, but immediately after logging in the same problem
  exists: the user is given a silent shell prompt without any
  confirmation that their login was successful or that the computer
  awaits their next command.  
</para>

<para>
  Probably the most sensible way to deal with this problem is to have
  <application>emacspeak</application> automatically launch after a
  successful login; this provides audio cues that the login was
  successful as well as eliminating the redundancy of manually
  launching <application>emacspeak</application> every time the user
  logs into the system.
</para>

<screen>
  <prompt>darkstar:~&#36; </prompt> <command>echo</command> &#39;exec
  &#47;usr&#47;bin&#47;emacspeak&#39; &#62;&#62; ~&#47;.bash_profile
</screen>

<para>
  Reboot and test the new configuration; not only should the user be
  audibly prompted to login, but immediately after login
  <application>emacspeak</application> should launch. In fact, any new
  shell that the user creates will launch an instance of
  <application>emacspeak</application>.

<para>
  Combined with the inherent power of GNU <application>emacs</application>
  and the addition of all of its extensions such as the
  <application>w3m</application> web browser,
  <application>eshell</application> console,
  <application>wl</application> email client,
  <application>org-mode</application> organizer,
  <application>dired</application> file manager,
  <application>emms</application> multimedia player, a non-sighted user
  has a robust, stable, and powerful Slackware Linux system.
