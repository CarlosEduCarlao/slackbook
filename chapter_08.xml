<title>Choosing A Printer</title>

<para>
Linux hasn't always had a great history with printers. For many years,
printing was a black art to many Linux users, and very few printers
worked reliably. Today, most printers will work well with Linux, but
some still do not. If you're purchasing a new printer, be aware that
many of the cheap inkjet models aren't as well supported in Linux as
more expensive laser printers. If you're unsure about a printer, you
can check online to see if others have had success with it.

All these warnings are perhaps a bit overkill though, as the large
majority of printers work with Linux after only a brief and simple
setup. The progress in this direction is largely due to the efforts of
the Common UNIX Printing System, (CUPS). CUPS is a printing system used
by Slackware and most other Linux distributions today. It primarily uses
a graphical setup procedure accessed via a web browser. In order to
setup a printer with CUPS, you'll need to open a web browser such as
firefox, konqueror, or links and go to 
<ulink url="http://localhost:631">http://localhost:631</ulink>.

<title>Setting Up a Printer in CUPS</title>

<para>
From this point onward, setting up a printer is just a series of
following the step-by-step instructions with CUPS, but a few areas
merit some clarification.

<title>Commandline Print Utilities</title>

Using the command <command>lpr</command>(1) to print files, is a simple task.
It can queue a print job using a file or standard input (stdin).
Refer to the manpages for more options.
